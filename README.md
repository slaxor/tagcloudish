Tagclouish
==========

*Hi,*

  this is a small programming doodle i wrote to show off my programming style in javascript. I'm not entirely
  sure about its market value, but apart from being fun to program it shows some important - for me at least -
  programming paradigms.

  This is how you use it:

      git clone git@github.com:slaxor/tagcloudish.git
      cd tagcloudish
      npm install
      npm run-script example
      xdg-open http://127.0.0.1:3000/Heinrich_Heine-Deutschland-Ein-Wintermaerchen
